# Release

embedm v0.9.7

- **File embedding** — embed entire files, named regions (`md.start:name` / `md.end:name`), or line ranges (`5..10`) from any source file; Markdown sources merge inline, all others wrap in a fenced code block with optional title and source link
- **Symbol extraction** — extract classes and methods by name from C/C++, C#, and Java source files using dot-notation; overloaded methods disambiguated by parameter signature
- **Structured data queries** — extract any value from JSON, YAML, TOML, or XML using dot-notation path expressions; scalars render inline with optional format strings, structures render as YAML blocks
- **CSV/TSV tables** — render tabular data as Markdown tables with column selection, row filtering, sorting, and pagination
- **Table of contents** — auto-generated from document headings including headings in embedded files; GitHub-compatible anchor slugs, configurable depth, duplicate heading disambiguation
- **`synopsis` plugin** — generate a condensed summary of a compiled document for use as an overview or index entry
- **`recall` plugin** — query a source document by topic and extract the most relevant sentences; compose multiple targeted queries into a focused AI agent context file
- **`--verify` mode** — compile and compare against existing output without writing; exits with code 1 if any file is stale, for use in CI drift detection pipelines
- **Verbosity levels** — four-level output control (`-v 0` silent through `-v 3` verbose); default level 2 shows per-file progress and errors; level 3 adds config, plan tree, timing, and cache events
- **Safety and configuration** — configurable limits on file size, memory, recursion depth, and embed output size via `embedm-config.yaml`; path access control; `--accept-all` for non-interactive pipelines; `--dry-run` for preview without writing
