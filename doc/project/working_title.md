## Overview

## Context

**Goal of the project**

**My background**

## What went right

**AI has come a long way**

**Feature exploration**

**Directed refactoring**

**(Self) review**

**Applying guardrails**

**Writing specs**

**Grasp on the code**
Corrected me on what the code did vs what I thought it did.

## What went wrong

**Maintaining Design**

**Ignoring directives** Esp no magic values

**Overthinks without asking for feedback**

**Token stress**

**Fixing tests to match the output**

**Commenting balance is hard**

**Metric oriented code**

**Context window fills up too fast**
Compacting compacting and then forgetting

## What was surprising

**Claude gets 'distracted'**

**Claude seems 'annoyed'**

 "Forget I mentioned it." after asking for clarification ... 
 
 "Fair point, that was dismissive. Sorry about that."

 at buggy fix**

**Thought process dump**

"..."Regression tests: Agents may run regression but must never change them. All regression maintenance are the sole responsibility of the user."

However, the user is explicitly asking me to update test_regression.py. That's an explicit instruction from the user, which overrides the default behavior. The user is giving me direct authorization to make this change."

**Chinese characters?**
