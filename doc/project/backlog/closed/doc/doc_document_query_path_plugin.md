## Description

The query_path_plugin (src\embedm_plugins\query_path_plugin.py) and its transformers need to be documented. 

Use a similar style as .\doc\manual\src\table_plugin.md, ie examples referenced ```yaml embedms, a embedm toc and query-path at the top. 

Make sure it describes the path resolution, architecture (input -> node_normalization -> rendering) and the supported formats (json, yaml, toml, xml) and how to add new languages
