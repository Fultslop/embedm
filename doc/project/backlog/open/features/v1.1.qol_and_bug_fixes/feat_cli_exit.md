## Description

When running against a directory and errors occur, the user currently has no way to stop the entire process. Pressing 'n' only blocks the current file from being processed. If the user wants to stop, they have to press ctrl+C. 

We want the user to have the option to press 'C', 'cancel ALL operations'  effectively calling 'exit'.

## Acceptance criteria
