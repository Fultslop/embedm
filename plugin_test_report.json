  ],
  "feedback": [
    "The tutorial recommends 'pip install -e .' without clarifying which pip. On a project using uv, the project venv has no pip module, and the system pip targets a different Python. The tutorial should explicitly state 'install into the same environment that runs embedm' with examples for uv-based projects: 'uv pip install -e . --python <path-to-venv-python>'.",
    "The tutorial mentions 'uv pip install embedm' for setup but switches back to plain 'pip install -e .' for plugin installation — inconsistent. It should stay consistent with one tool throughout.",
    "The environment-alignment callout in the tutorial is present but appears after the install step. Moving it before the install command would reduce confusion.",
    "The 'embedm -p' diagnostic correctly surfaces the 'no matching installed entry point' warning, which was the key signal that pointed to the wrong environment — this is good UX.",
    "embedm --init correctly generated embedm-config.yaml with a plugin_sequence section ready to be extended — no friction here."
